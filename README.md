## ⚙️ Workflow Summary

### 1️⃣ **Data Ingestion and Management**
- Uploaded `bank.csv` into **HDFS**.
- Created Hive database `banking_data` and table `client_info`.
- Queried average balance, default rate, and subscription trends.

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Spark**
- Loaded data into **Spark DataFrame**.  
- Performed filtering, grouping, and visualization.  
- Derived new features: `quarter`, `age_group`, and `month_num`.

### 3️⃣ **Predictive Modeling (Spark MLlib)**
- Used **StringIndexer**, **OneHotEncoder**, and **VectorAssembler** for preprocessing.
- Built **Logistic Regression** & **Decision Tree Classifiers**.  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy**, **AUC**, and **CrossValidator** tuning.
- Extracted **feature importance** for interpretability.

### 4️⃣ **Real-Time Machine Learning (Spark Streaming)**
- Simulated live transaction data by chunking `bank.csv`.  
- Processed streams with **Structured Streaming**.  
- Applied trained model for **real-time predictions**.  
- Implemented **windowing & watermarking** for trend analysis and late data handling.

### 5️⃣ **Data Parallelism & Efficiency**
- Leveraged Spark’s distributed computing for scalability.
- Reduced computation time by parallelizing ETL and ML pipelines.
